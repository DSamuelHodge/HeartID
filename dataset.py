Secure Triplet Loss Project Repository (https://github.com/jtrpinto/SecureTL)

File: dataset.py
- Uses torch's Dataset class to import the Secure datasets of ECG
  to be used to train or test the models.

  Info on the dataset files needed:

  SecureECGDataset require a pickle file, e.g. "ecg_data.pickle", which stores 
  a tuple of six numpy arrays. The first three numpy arrays correspond to the 
  anchors, the positives, and the negatives, respectively. The fourth array 
  includes the IDs of the anchors on each triplet. The fifth and sixth arrays 
  correspond to the cancelable keys of each triplet, k1 and k2, respectively.
  See "ecg_prepare_uoftdb.py" for more details.
